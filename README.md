**`Software Engineering Student/Intern`**

I'm a passionate software engineering student with a relatively good foundation in computer science and programming principles that is currently interning at Felda Global Venture based in Malaysia. My curiosity and eagerness to learn have led me to explore various technologies and programming languages, including PHP, HTML, CSS, C++ and Java. I'm always on the lookout for exciting new challenges to improve my skills and broaden my horizons.

I believe in the power of open-source software and the importance of contributing to the community. In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects and experimenting with new tools. I'm dedicated to writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code that solves real-world problems.
